#Code Blocks#
    Pre-formatted code blocks are used fro writing about programming or markup
    source code. Rather than forming normal paragraphs the lines of a code
    block are interpreted literally. Markdown wraps a code block in both <pre>
    and <code> tags

    To produce a code block in Markdown simply indent every line of the block
    by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab
    Regular markdown syntax is not processed within code blocks
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>
